        "This Jupyter notebook provides a complete Proof of Concept (POC) for an Adaptive Meeting Notes Generator. It uses Generative AI to transform meeting transcripts into multi-layered summaries tailored for different audiences:\n",
        "- **Executives**: High-level insights.\n",
        "- **Teams**: Clear action items.\n",
        "- **Interns/Juniors**: Simplified recaps.\n",
        "\n",

        "## System Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Input Processing**\n",
        "   - **Source**: Meeting transcripts (text or audio converted to text via speech-to-text APIs like Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text).\n",
        "   - **Preprocessing**: Clean transcript (remove filler words, correct grammar, segment by speaker/topic).\n",
        "   - **Metadata**: User inputs for audience type (executive, team, junior) and optional flags for sentiment or technical analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Generative AI Core**\n",
        "   - **Model**: A fine-tuned large language model (e.g., GPT-4, Llama, or xAI’s Grok) optimized for summarization and audience-specific tone.\n",
        "   - **Prompt Engineering**:\n",
        "     - **Executive Summary**: “Generate a concise, high-level summary of the meeting, focusing on strategic insights, key decisions, and outcomes in 100-150 words.”\n",
        "     - **Team Action Items**: “Extract and list clear, actionable tasks from the meeting transcript, assigning owners and deadlines where specified, in bullet-point format.”\n",
        "     - **Junior Recap**: “Create a simplified, plain-language summary of the meeting in 200-250 words, avoiding jargon and explaining key concepts.”\n",
        "     - **Sentiment Analysis (Optional)**: “Analyze the tone of the meeting (positive, neutral, negative) and highlight key emotional drivers or conflicts.”\n",
        "     - **Technical Deep-Dive (Optional)**: “Provide a detailed explanation of technical topics discussed, including diagrams or code snippets if relevant.”\n",
        "   - **Context Awareness**: The model uses metadata (e.g., meeting type, audience role) to adjust tone, depth, and focus.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Output Formatting**\n",
        "   - Outputs are generated in structured formats (e.g., JSON, Markdown) for easy integration into tools like Notion, Slack, or email.\n",
        "   - Example output structure:\n",
        "     ```json\n",
        "     {\n",
        "       \"executive_summary\": \"...\",\n",
        "       \"team_action_items\": [\"Task 1: ...\", \"Task 2: ...\"],\n",
        "       \"junior_recap\": \"...\",\n",
        "       \"sentiment_analysis\": {...},\n",
        "       \"technical_deep_dive\": \"...\"\n",
        "     }\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Integration Layer**\n",
        "   - **APIs**: Connects to meeting platforms (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) for real-time transcript access.\n",
        "   - **Delivery**: Outputs delivered via email, Slack, or a web dashboard with role-based access (e.g., executives only see high-level summaries).\n",
        "   - **Customization**: Users can tweak summary length, tone, or focus via a configuration interface."

        "## Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Meeting Recording and Transcription**\n",
        "   - Audio/video from the meeting is captured via the meeting platform’s recording feature.\n",
        "   - Speech-to-text API converts audio to text in real time or post-meeting.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **User Configuration**\n",
        "   - Users specify audience types (executive, team, junior) and optional analyses (sentiment, technical) via a web interface or meeting tool plugin.\n",
        "   - Example: A manager selects “Executive Summary + Team Action Items + Sentiment Analysis” for a project kickoff.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **AI Processing**\n",
        "   - The transcript is segmented into topics using natural language processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., topic modeling with BERT).\n",
        "   - The Generative AI model processes the transcript based on the configured prompts, generating tailored outputs.\n",
        "   - Optional modules (sentiment, technical) are triggered if selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Output Delivery**\n",
        "   - Summaries are formatted and sent to designated recipients (e.g., executives get a PDF report, teams get Slack notifications with action items).\n",
        "   - Outputs are stored in a searchable database for future reference."
